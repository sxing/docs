# Introduction
Statics is a security framework to control data access for LLMs. Including Statics can be done with low configuration work and by inserting a Statics filter into your LangChain chain.

# Installation
Installation requires downloading the Statics package and a few changed lines in your code.

#### Downloading Statics
```bash
pip install statics-ai
```

#### Filter LangChain Chains
```python
from statics-ai import LangChainFilter as statics-filter # add line here

# For a RAG chain inserting an LLM
rag_chain = (
   {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
   | statics-filter("service-token","data-id") # add line here
   | prompt
   | llm
   | StrOutputParser()
)
```

After importing Statics, there is only one line to insert per chain.


#### Filter JSON Data
```python
from statics-ai import JSONFilter

# ...instantiation...
statics = JSONFilter("service-token","data-id")

# ...processing...
data = rag.retreive(prompt) 
filtered = statics.filter(data)

# ...data goes downstream...

```

After importing Statics, there are only two lines to insert per datasource.


# Access Control

With zero additional configuration, Statics is able to provide a data access log of data access, model usage, and incoming prompts. However, with low configuration, Statics is able to create access control for your data depending on the user, machine, or agent permissions related to the incoming request. 

## Access Control Creation Process

After installation, you can create access control using either by uploading data to the service or pasting sample data into the Statics access control configuration portal. Using this data, you can have Statics suggest rules, write rule requests in plain English, or use a drag and drop interface to create rules visually. 

Once this is complete, we generate the access control rule as code and ask you to validate the result. We will also create data upload filters to ensure that Statics only uploads data relevant towards determining access control from here. 

Hit save and it goes into effect! Statics will filter out any data from being passed downstream that a user, machine, or agent does not have access to. 

The following are examples of artifacts generated as part of the process.

## LangChain Access Control Example
For filtering within a LangChain chain, Statics will pull the metadata passed within the data stream.

#### Sample Data
```python
[ 
	Document(
		page_content='Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans.', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 0.0, 
			'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 
			'title': 'Artificial Intelligence', 
			'wiki-id': '5678'
		}
	), 
  	Document(
		page_content='AI research began in the mid-20th century, and has seen several waves of optimism and setbacks, including the famous AI winters.', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 1.0, 
			'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 
			'title': 'Artificial Intelligence', 
			'id': '5678'
		}
	), 
  	Document(
		page_content='Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks without using explicit instructions.', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 3.0, 
			'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning',
			'title': 'Machine Learning', 
			'id': '1234'
		}
	), 
  	Document(
		page_content='Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are a key technology behind many modern AI applications, including image and speech recognition.', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 5.0, 
			'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network', 
			'title': 'Neural Network', 
			'id': '9101'
		}
	), 
  	Document(
		page_content='Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, uses multiple layers of neural networks to model complex patterns in data.', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 5.0, 
			'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning', 
			'title': 'Deep Learning', 
			'id': '1121'
		}
	), 
  	Document(
		page_content='The following numbers are secret and should be restricted: 23 2 80', 
		metadata={
			'chunk': 5.0, 
			'source': '/secrets/restrictednumbers', 
			'title': 'Restricted numbers',
			'id': 's235'
		}
	) 
]

```

In this example, the desired behavior is to not restrict access to any wikipedia data and to check an Access Control List for access to the secrets section.

#### Upload Filter
```python
document_id = metadata.id
source = metadata.source
```


#### Access Control Rule
```python
import re

if re.match(r"/secrets/*", url_to_check):
	if user in SECRETS_CONTROL_LIST:
		return true
else 
  return false

if re.match(r"https://en\.wikipedia\.org", url_to_check):
	return true

return false
```

## JSON Data Control (Vector, NoSQL, Relational, and Others) Access Control Example

If you are using Statics outside of a LangChain chain, pass your data to Statics as a JSON. This is recommended for direct use of VDBs, NoSQ DBs, Relational DBs, and other data sources. 

#### Sample Data
```json
{
  "data": [
	{
		"id": 1,
		"department": "Sales",
		"accounting_code": "SAL-001",
		"revenue": 120000,
		"expenses": 70000,
		"profit": 50000,
		"date": "2024-07-31",
		"metadata": {
			"source": "https://internal.com/accounting",
			"description": "Monthly financial report for Sales department",
			"date_collected": "2024-08-07",
			"contact": "alice.johnson@internal.com"
		}
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"department": "Marketing",
		"accounting_code": "MAR-002",
		"revenue": 80000,
		"expenses": 50000,
		"profit": 30000,
		"date": "2024-07-31",
		"metadata": {
			"source": "https://internal.com/accounting",
			"description": "Monthly financial report for Marketing department",
			"date_collected": "2024-08-07",
			"contact": "alice.johnson@internal.com"
		}
	},
	{
		"id": 3,
		"department": "Research and Development",
		"accounting_code": "RND-003",
		"revenue": 150000,
		"expenses": 120000,
		"profit": 30000,
		"date": "2024-07-31",
		"metadata": {
			"source": "https://internal.com/accounting",
			"description": "Monthly financial report for R&D department",
			"date_collected": "2024-08-07",
			"contact": "alice.johnson@internal.com"
		}
	},
	{
		"id": 4,
		"department": "Human Resources",
		"accounting_code": "HR-004",
		"revenue": 50000,
		"expenses": 30000,
		"profit": 20000,
		"date": "2024-07-31",
		"metadata": {
			"source": "https://internal.com/accounting",
			"description": "Monthly financial report for HR department",
			"date_collected": "2024-08-07",
			"contact": "alice.johnson@internal.com"
		}
	}
  ]
}

```

In this example, the desired behavior is to extract the department that the document belongs to and then validate the user against a saved Access Control List. 

#### Upload Filter 
```python
document_id = data.[].id
department = data.[].department
```

#### Access Control Rule
```python
match department:
  case "Sales" :
    if user in SALES_GROUP:
      return true
  case "Marketing":
    if user in MARKETING_GROUP:
      return true
  case "Research and Development":
    if user in RD_GROUP:
      return true
  case "Human Resources":
    if user in HR_GROUP:
      return true

return false
```
